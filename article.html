            <h2>Dewi</h2>

            <p>Dewi is a beautiful and amazing human being living in the Dewiverse. The Dewiverse is full of life
                wisdom, colours, garlands, self-help podcasts, hand-written letters, bullet points and snacks.
                Dewi likes to consult external sources for guidance on how to live life, perceive the world and deal
                with other beings,
                but sometimes forgets she already has an entire Dewiverse inside of her to guide and direct her from
                within. That's why we
                have created this external wiki of Dewiness. </p>

                    <p>De・wi <span class="fakelink">/ˈdeɪwi/</span> "De" means 'the' and "wi(e)" means 'who'. This
                        expresses the duality in Dewi; the constant flow between defining things and questioning who
                        people are, including herself. [Dew・i] can also be explained as <span
                            class="fakelink">dew</span> (water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed
                        objects in the morning or evening due to condensation) and <span class="fakelink">I</span>, a
                        vertical vowel used to refer
                        to oneself.</p>

                        <p>One could say Dewi buzzes through life like a little bee buzzing from flower to flower. She
                            likes many types of
                            flowers, especially wild flowers. She may be a bit of a <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflower">wildflower</a> herself. She also owns a
                            book
                            about them. Therefor we can conclude that Dewi has
                            both theoretical and empirical knowledge about wild flowers.
