            <h2>Dewi</h2>

            <p>Dewi is a beautiful and amazing human being living in the Dewiverse. The Dewiverse is full of life
                wisdom, colours, garlands, self-help podcasts, hand-written letters, bullet points and snacks.
                Dewi likes to consult external sources for guidance on how to live life, perceive the world and deal
                with other beings,
                but sometimes forgets she already has an entire Dewiverse inside of her to guide and direct her from
                within. That's why we
                have created this external wiki of Dewiness. </p>

                    <p>De・wi <span class="fakelink">/ˈdeɪwi/</span> "De" means 'the' and "wi(e)" means 'who'. This
                        expresses the duality in Dewi; the constant flow between defining things and questioning who
                        people are, including herself. [Dew・i] can also be explained as <span
                            class="fakelink">dew</span> (water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed
                        objects in the morning or evening due to condensation) and <span class="fakelink">I</span>, a
                        vertical vowel used to refer
                        to oneself.</p>

                        <p>One could say Dewi buzzes through life like a little bee buzzing from flower to flower. She
                            likes many types of
                            flowers, especially wild flowers. She may be a bit of a <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflower">wildflower</a> herself. She also owns a
                            book
                            about them. Therefor we can conclude that Dewi has
                            both theoretical and empirical knowledge about wild flowers.

                        <p>Dewi's heart is much like a strawberry. She has love for many people, and just like a
                            strawberry
                            plant
                            sends out runners to create new plants, Dewi's love spreads to those around her, creating
                            new
                            connections and deepening existing ones. As she nurtures these relationships with care and
                            attention, her love, like a strawberry fruit, ripens and becomes more mature over time. And
                            like
                            the growth process of a strawberry plant, expressing and sharing love also requires patience
                            and
                            perseverance. Dewi understands this and puts in the effort needed to cultivate strong and
                            lasting relationships, just as a gardener tends to their plants with diligence and care.
                            Ultimately, just as a ripe strawberry is a sweet and delicious treat, the love that Dewi
                            shares
                            brings joy and happiness to those fortunate enough to receive it. </p>
